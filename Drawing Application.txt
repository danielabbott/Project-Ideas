Sparse texture for each layer - only allocate memory for 128x128 pixel blocks which contain image data
OpenGL fallback: texture per 128x128 region.

Project is stored across multiple files
Configuration file for metadata & vector layers, .png file for every bitmap layer

Option for exporting to .tar file with lossless webp instead of png (for backups/transfer)

Use game engine project for abstraction over graphics APIs, window management, input (tablet), GUI
SVG project for vector graphics
