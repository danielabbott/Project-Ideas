NV_path_rendering?

Divide image into 8x8 pixel blocks
Each block has a list of vector elements which are (partly) in the 8x8 region
Fragment shader runs for each pixel, access list for block pixel is in, determines pixel colour.

For each path:
Go across scanline from pixel in direction towards nearest edge, count intersections on each side of pixel
Find all intersections between current scanline (horizontal row of pixels across full width of canvas) and the edges of the path
Number of intersections is always even
If number of intersections on each side is odd then the pixel is inside the shape.

Convert SVG path data to list of points?
Store in a R32f buffer texture.
1 float for opcode (move/line/curve/etc.)
2+ parameters depending on opcode

Font rendering?
Convert characters to paths.
