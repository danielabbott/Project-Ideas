Octree of cube textures (ray casting)
Each voxel stores a normal (r8g8, normalised (z is derived from x and y in shader))
Bilinear filtering
Chunks can be in sparse texture or octree stores sampler index

Each entry in octree is either empty, solid, or 8 child indices

Octree parsed per-pixel on GPU
