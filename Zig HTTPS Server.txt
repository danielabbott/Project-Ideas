Take old io uring zig https server project and upgrade to latest zig version & change to use zig stdlib io uring code instead of liburing.

Game engine project will have io uring abstraction for thread-per-core server model, maybe move that into a separate library repo

Could implement HTTP2
HTTP3 (quic)?
